## Introduction

I have been working in the industry for some time now and I have been on both sides of the interview process. Being the decision maker, I like to learn about the candidate's experiences through their portfolios. I am not overlooking the importance of a resume here, but I think a portfolio is a great way to showcase your work and your personality. With friends who are looking to join the industry and showcase their projects, I decided to write this post to share my experience building a personal page for free. In this process, you will learn how to build a static site with Hugo, host it with GitHub Pages, and automate the deployment with GitHub Actions.

## Prerequisites

- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) installed on your local machine if you are using Windows
- [Brew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) installed on your local machine if you are using Mac
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your local machine (You can install this with Chocolatey or brew)
- A [Github](https://github.com/) account

I am using Windows for this tutorial, but you can easily follow along if you are using Mac or Linux.

## Creating a static site with Hugo

Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. It is fast and easy to use and I am loving it so far. You can find the official documentation [here](https://gohugo.io/documentation/). To install Hugo, you can use the following command if you are using Windows:

```bash
choco install hugo-extended
```

Alternatively, you can find the installation guide [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

Once you have Hugo installed, you can create a new site with the following command:

```bash
hugo new site quickstart
cd quickstart
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod
echo "theme = 'PaperMod'" >> config.yaml
hugo server
```

Depending on the theme you choose, you may need to change the theme name in the `config.yaml` file. In this case, I am using the PaperMod theme which offers a minimal design with lots of configurable options. You can find more themes [here](https://themes.gohugo.io/). Voala! You have a static site running locally. You can access it at http://localhost:1313/.

## Hosting the site with Github Pages

Github Pages is a free service offered by Github to host static sites. You can find the official documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages). To host your site with GitHub Pages, you need to create a new repository with the name \<your_github_username\>.github.io. For example, my Github username is ew820513, so I created a new repository with the name ew820513.github.io.

Hugo has a built-in command to generate static content. You can run the following command to generate the static content:

```bash
hugo
```

You may be wondering, the tutorial is asking for static `index.html` files, how to get Github Pages to work with the generated public content from hugo? Need not to worry, that is where the next step comes in.

## Automate the deployment with Github Actions

GitHub actions make it easy to publish your static site. Navigate to *Settings > Pages* of the repository you created earlier. Select the following options:

![Suggested Workflow](/20230507-hugo/Screenshot%202023-05-09%20230957.png)

After following the prompt and completing the commit, you finished creating your personal website site! You can access it at https://\<your_github_username\>.github.io. What is even better is that your blog is under source control and every time you push a commit to the repository, GitHub will automatically build and deploy the site for you! So now, you can focus on writing your blog and let Github take care of the rest.

## Summary

In this post, you learned how to build a static site with Hugo, host it with GitHub Pages, and automate the deployment with Github Actions. I hope you find this post helpful and I look forward to seeing your portfolio site. If you have any questions, please feel free to leave a comment below.
